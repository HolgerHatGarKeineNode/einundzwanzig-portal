# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.5. You are an expert with the Laravel ecosystem. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:
- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

# Laravel Boost

## Project Rules

- This project contains committed, area-grouped rules in `.ai/rules` when that directory exists (settled decisions, non-obvious traps, standing constraints). Framework and package guidelines that only apply to specific paths (testing, frontend, components) also live there, under `.ai/rules/boost` — this is not just recorded decisions, it is load-bearing guidance you have not seen inline. Before you enter plan mode or create/edit any file, you MUST first: open @.ai/rules/index.md (it maps file globs to rule files), read every rule file whose globs cover the path(s) in scope, and run `grep -rin 'keyword' .ai/rules` to catch what a path match alone misses. Do not write code until you have read and are following every matching rule. If `.ai/rules` does not exist, continue without it.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.
- **Never run the full suite unfiltered in an automated context.** `php artisan test --compact` includes the `Browser` testsuite, which starts a Playwright server; where none can start it hangs with no output until something kills it. Measured 2026-09-01: 25+ minutes of silence, twice, on a change that touched only `lang/en.json`. Scope it instead:

  ```
  timeout 900 php artisan test --compact --exclude-testsuite=Browser
  ```

  Browser assertions stay available on purpose — run them deliberately through `vendor/bin/pest --agent='…'`, never as a side effect of a full run.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allow to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== spatie/laravel-medialibrary/core rules ===

## Media Library

- `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` associates files with Eloquent models, with support for collections, conversions, and responsive images.
- Always activate the `medialibrary-development` skill when working with media uploads, conversions, collections, responsive images, or any code that uses the `HasMedia` interface or `InteractsWithMedia` trait.

=== pestphp/pest-plugin-agent/core rules ===

## Pest Agent Plugin

`vendor/bin/pest --agent="<code>"` runs a one-off Pest assertion without creating a test file — the fastest way to verify that a change actually works (a route response, a model relationship, a rendered page, a form submission, mail firing, a screenshot, JavaScript errors, and so on).

### ALWAYS load the skill first

Whenever the user asks you to check, verify, confirm, or "make sure" something **works** — and it can be exercised on a route, page, form, model, job, mail, notification, or screenshot — you **MUST** load the **`pest-plugin-agent` skill before doing anything else**. Do not reach for a shell command, a throwaway test file, or manual reasoning first. This includes prompts like "verify the login form works", "did my change break X", "screenshot the homepage", "check this route returns 200", "make sure the mail fires", "is the form working", or any behavioral check after a Blade, Livewire, CSS, or JS change. Load the skill, then follow it exactly.

### NEVER fight shell escaping — use SINGLE outer quotes

Inline the snippet, but wrap it in **single** quotes, not double. Single quotes tell the shell to interpret nothing, so `$variables`, `\App\Models\User`, backticks, and `!` all pass through to PHP literally — **there is nothing to escape.** Use double quotes for PHP string literals inside:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest --agent='$user = \App\Models\User::factory()->create(); visit("/login")->type("email", $user->email)->press("Log in")->assertPathIs("/dashboard");'
```

Double outer quotes are the trap the shell springs on you — `--agent="…$user…"` makes the shell interpolate `$user` to nothing. Never do that, and never hand-escape `\$`.

The one thing single quotes can't contain is a literal single quote (an apostrophe in the PHP). Only then, fall back to a file: **Write** the snippet to a `.php` file (plain body statements — no `<?php`, no `use`, fully qualified class names) and run `vendor/bin/pest --agent="$(cat /path/to/snippet.php)"`. `"$(cat …)"` passes the contents verbatim without re-parsing. The plugin resolves the test suite's `uses`/namespace itself, so the file's location does not matter (a scratch/temp path is fine — it need not live under `tests/`).

### Browser checks require the browser plugin — ask before installing

Whenever the request can only be answered in a real browser — "does login work", "is the page responsive", "screenshot the homepage", "check the mobile layout", "does the button click through", "are there JS/console errors", or any visual/interaction check — the `visit()` browser API is needed. It comes from a **separate** package, `pestphp/pest-plugin-browser`, which is powered by Playwright.

If `visit()` is undefined (or the package is not installed), **do not install it silently — ask the user for permission first**, since it pulls in Node/Playwright dependencies and downloads browser binaries. Explain that the browser check needs it and confirm before running these commands:

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-browser --dev   # the browser plugin (needs Node.js)

npm install playwright@latest                         # Playwright driver

npx playwright install                                # download the browser binaries

```

Once the user approves and it's installed, add `tests/Browser/Screenshots` to `.gitignore` so captured screenshots aren't committed. Browser assertions then run through the same `vendor/bin/pest --agent='…'` flow:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest --agent='visit("/login")->type("email", "test@example.com")->type("password", "password")->press("Log in")->assertPathIs("/dashboard");'
vendor/bin/pest --agent='visit("/")->on()->mobile()->screenshot(fullPage: false, filename: "home-mobile");'
```

For full usage — backend examples, browser testing, screenshots, responsive checks, combining frontend and backend assertions, RefreshDatabase guidance, and pitfalls — load the **`pest-plugin-agent` skill**.
